# Error Codes

::: danger Codes are scoped to their endpoint
The same numeric code means different things on different endpoints, and on some endpoints
it means two different things depending on the message. `006` is a reused transaction ID on
the outbound call and a past start time on queue upload. Do not write a shared error-code
map. Branch on which endpoint returned the code, then read the `message`.
:::

## HTTP status is always 200

Every middleware endpoint on this site returns a plain response body with HTTP `200`,
including on failure. Nothing signals an error through the status line. Read `status` from
the body.

```ts
const res = await fetch(url, opts);
const json = await res.json();

// res.ok is true here even when json.status is "011"
```

## Success conventions

Three endpoint families use three different conventions:

| Endpoints | Success looks like |
| --- | --- |
| Outbound call, queue upload | `"status": "001"` |
| Content upload | `"status": 200` (number), message in `msg` |
| Callback routing | `"status": 0` (number) |
| Recording export | `"status": "SUCCESS"`, with `"statusCode": "0000"` |

```ts
function isSuccess(json: { status: string | number }): boolean {
  return (
    json.status === "001" ||
    json.status === 200 ||
    json.status === 0 ||
    json.status === "SUCCESS"
  );
}
```

## POST /api/outbound-call

| Code | Message | Cause |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `001` | Unauthorized | Basic auth failed, or the username is not a known PBX agent. |
| `002` | Missing parameter | On `CAMPAIGN`, one of `companyId`, `transactionId`, `startTime`, `contentId`, `toNumber` is absent. |
| `003` | Start time is in the past | `startTime` is before current server time. |
| `004` | company not found | Invalid `companyId`. |
| `005` | Invalid serviceId | `serviceId` is not registered against this company. |
| `006` | Transaction Id unavailable | This `transactionId` has been used before. |
| `007` | company hotline number not found | No hotline configured for the company. |
| `008` | Invalid response from external API | The downstream scheduling call failed. |
| `008` | Internal server error | Unhandled failure. |
| `009` | Content not found | The DRM lookup returned nothing. |
| `009` | Invalid content ID | A referenced content ID exists but is not usable. |
| `011` | Invalid toNumber | Does not match `0` followed by 9 digits. |
| `012` | Missing dtmfOptions for SURVEY | Required for `SURVEY`. |
| `013` | Missing contentMapping for SURVEY | Required for `SURVEY`. |
| `014` | Missing contentMapping for key | A DTMF or reserved key has no mapping. |
| `015` | Duplicate DTMF keys not allowed | A key appears twice in `dtmfOptions`. |
| `018` | File mapping validation failed | `contentMapping` is not in `key:contentId` form. |
| `018` | Internal server error | Unhandled failure in the scheduling service. |

## POST /api/queue/start-upload

| Code | Message | Cause |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `005` | Missing parameter | A required parameter was omitted. |
| `006` | Start time is in the past | `startTime` is before current server time. |
| `007` | Unauthorized | Basic auth failed. |
| `008` | Invalid queue or company | `companyId` or `queueId` not found. |
| `009` | CSV contains invalid number: `<entry>` | A row failed validation. |
| `400` | Unhandled Error | Unhandled failure during processing. |
| `500` | Failed to parse CSV | The file could not be read as CSV. |
| `500` | Check Lead Ids Again | No usable lead IDs were found. |

`400` and `500` here are values of the `status` string, not HTTP statuses.

## POST /api/content/v1/add

| status | msg | Cause |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `2` | Internal Server Error! | Unhandled failure. |
| `3` | Session Not Found! | The request was not authenticated. |
| `4` | Empty File! | No `attachment` was sent. |
| `5` | Empty Service ID! | No `serviceId` was sent. |
| `6` | Service Not Found! | `serviceId` does not belong to the agent's company. |
| `7` | (relayed from DRM) | DRM rejected the upload with a 401. |

## Direct agent mapping

`status: 1` is a rejected request. `status: 3` is a server-side failure.

| Status | Message |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Invalid Company ID |
| 1 | Invalid Hotline Number or Hotline does not belong to this Company |
| 1 | Invalid Agent Number. Must be 9 or 10 digits. |
| 1 | Invalid Customer Number. Must be 9 or 10 digits or 'ANY'. |
| 1 | Agent Number not found in PBX records for this Company. |
| 1 | A mapping already exists for this Agent and Customer within the requested time period. |
| 1 | Transaction ID not found |
| 1 | Mapping is already inactive |
| 3 | Failed to create mapping |
| 3 | Internal Server Error |
| 3 | Invalid Request |

## GET /download/call-recordings

| statusCode | Cause |
| --- | --- |
| `0000` | Success. |
| `0008` | Missing, non-Basic, or malformed `Authorization`, or the username is not a known PBX agent. |
| `0009` | Unhandled failure while building the export. |

## Gateway endpoints

[Call Records](/api/call-records) and [Call Record Counts](/api/call-record-counts) work
differently from the endpoints above. They use normal HTTP status codes, and an error body
looks like this:

```json
{ "code": "INVALID_CURSOR", "message": "Cursor is not valid for this company" }
```

| Status | `code` | Cause |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `400` | `INVALID_CURSOR` | The cursor was changed, cut off, or belongs to another company. |
| `400` | `INVALID_LIMIT` | `limit` is less than 1 or more than 1000. |
| `400` | `INVALID_RANGE` | Wrong `from` or `to` on counts, or a range of more than 31 days. |
| `401` | `UNAUTHORIZED` | `X-API-Key` is missing or wrong. |
| `429` | `TOO_EARLY` | You already have everything and called before `nextPollAfter`. |
| `429` | `RATE_LIMITED` | More than 60 requests in a minute. |
| `500`, `503` | `SERVER_ERROR` | Try again later with the same parameters. |

Both `429` responses include a `Retry-After` header, in seconds.

## Webhook receiver errors

These are codes your own system returns, not Dwesk's. Dwesk retries `400`, `500`, and
`503`, using the retry settings configured for your company. See [Webhooks](/webhooks/).

`NS-00115` is a validation error from a receiver that requires conditional fields
unconditionally. See
[Conditional Validation](/webhooks/connect-agent-call-end#conditional-validation).

## Common causes

A `401`, or `status` `001` or `007` with credentials you believe are correct, usually means
you are calling a hostname other than the one issued to your tenant. See
[Base URLs](/guide/environments).

A `404` on content upload means you used the middleware host. Content upload is served by
the web host.

An `011` means `toNumber` did not match `0` followed by exactly 9 digits. A 9-digit number
without the leading zero fails this check.

Start-time rejections on a freshly built timestamp happen because the server compares
against its own local time, not UTC and not yours. Schedule at least a minute ahead.

A `005` on a request that includes every field is usually capitalisation. The queue upload
file field is `File`, not `file`.
